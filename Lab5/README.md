# Stack Exercises

Using TDD, create a Stack which shall support the following operations:
* `IsEmpty()` to check if the stack is empty.
* `GetSize()` to return the size of the stack.
* `Push()` to place an element on the top of the stack.
* `Peek()` to look at the top element of the stack without removing it.
* `Pop()` to remove an element from the top of the stack.
